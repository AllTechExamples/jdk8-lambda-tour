This repository contains example files I use in my JDK8 / Lambdas / Streams / 
Collectors talks. 

The data files mcdonalds.csv, movies-mpaa.txt, ospd.txt and 
words.shakespeare.txt can be freely downloaded from Robert Sedgwick page
here : http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/data/. Bytheway, there are other 
very intersetings data sets on this page. 

You can find 3 examples here : 
- the Scrabble example, or "how good at Scrabble Shakespeare would have been?"
- the MacDonald example, or "Houston, we've got a problem"
- the Movie database example.
